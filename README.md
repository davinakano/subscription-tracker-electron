# subscription-tracker-electron

A subscription tracker, built with Electron and React, just so I know why I am broke (but caught up on all the TV shows and stuff).

This project is inspired by the great [Cassidy Williams](https://github.com/cassidoo)'s project [todometer](https://github.com/cassidoo/todometer).
